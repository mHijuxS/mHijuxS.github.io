Hey there! I'm a graduate in Cartographic Engineering and cybersecurity enthusiast who enjoys solving all sorts of challengesâ€”from CTFs, mathematics, and physics questions to real-world problems. At the moment I'm a holder of the following cybersecurity certificates:
- CPTS: Certified Penetration Testing Specialist by Hack the Box
- DCPT: Desec Certified Penetration Tester by Desec Security
- CRTA: Certified Red Teamer Analyst by Cyber Warfare Labs

I also enjoy writing about my experiences and sharing different perspectives in the hope of teaching others something new.

With that in mind, I decided to create this blog to share my thoughts and experiences with the world. It will mostly feature CTF writeups and challenge solutions, with an emphasis on the theory behind them to help both myself and others gain a deeper understanding of the subjects.

I hope you enjoy it!
